# Data-Preprocessing-in-Easy-Way
 Data preprocessing, a component of data preparation, describes any type of processing performed on raw data to prepare it for another data processing procedure.
 This is how I cleaned and prepared tha data.
1. I cleaned the data by simply deleting the missing values.
2. I filled missing values by using Mean & Median
3. I imputed missing values by class (by taking the reference of another column).
